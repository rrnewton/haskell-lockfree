Synopsis: A safe approach to CAS and other atomic ops in Haskell.

Description:
  After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it's
  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
  based on the concept of "Tickets".
 .
  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to
  add access to other variants that may be of
  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
 .
  Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.
  This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing the
  same interface.
