 * (c) The GHC Team, 2009
 *
 * Work-stealing Deque data structure
 * 
 * The implementation uses Double-Ended Queues with lock-free access
 * (thereby often called "deque") as described in
 *
 * D.Chase and Y.Lev, Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deque.
 * SPAA'05, July 2005, Las Vegas, USA.
 * ACM 1-58113-986-1/05/0007
 *
 * Author: Jost Berthold MSRC 07-09/2008
 *
 * The DeQue is held as a circular array with known length. Positions
 * of top (read-end) and bottom (write-end) always increase, and the
 * array is accessed with indices modulo array-size. While this bears
 * the risk of overflow, we assume that (with 64 bit indices), a
 * program must run very long to reach that point.
 * 
 * The write end of the queue (position bottom) can only be used with
 * mutual exclusion, i.e. by exactly one caller at a time.  At this
 * end, new items can be enqueued using pushBottom()/newSpark(), and
 * removed using popBottom()/reclaimSpark() (the latter implying a cas
 * synchronisation with potential concurrent readers for the case of
 * just one element).
 * 
 * Multiple readers can steal from the read end (position top), and
 * are synchronised without a lock, based on a cas of the top
 * position. One reader wins, the others return NULL for a failure.
 * 
 * Both popWSDeque and stealWSDeque also return NULL when the queue is empty.
 *
 * Testing: see testsuite/tests/rts/testwsdeque.c.  If
 * there's anything wrong with the deque implementation, this test
 * will probably catch it.
