-- | This module provides a wrapper around a deque that can enforce additional
-- invariants at runtime for debugging purposes.

-- | Warning, this enforces the excessively STRONG invariant that if any end of the
-- deque is non-threadsafe then it may ever only be touched by one thread during its
-- entire lifetime.
--
-- This extreme form of monagamy is easier to verify, because we don't have enough
-- information to know if two operations on different threads are racing with one
-- another or are properly synchronized.
--
-- The wrapper data structure has two IORefs to track the last thread that touched
-- the left and right end of the deque, respectively.
